# Unit Tests
Test cases should be configured for success first. If modification to the
configuration is required for deeper testing, modification should be
as little as reasonably necessary when compared to initial configuration.

This should allow tests to continue to operate as intended in situations
where the "order of operations" within a function is changed.
