/**
 * @file peach.h
 * @brief Peach Proof-of-Work algorithm support.
 * @details The Peach algorithm was designed, specificaly, with the
 * intention of permitting a "mining advantage" to modern GPUs with
 * more than 1GiB VRAM where it can cache data faster than it would
 * take to re-compute it.
 * <br />
 * The cache is made of 1048576 x 1KibiByte chunks (a.k.a tiles) of
 * data, generated deterministically from the previous blocks hash,
 * making it unique per block solve. The generation process, dubbed
 * Nighthash, generates chunks using deterministic single precision
 * floating point operations, a selection of eight different memory
 * transformations, and finally a selection of eight different hash
 * algorithms. The final digest is then placed within the first row
 * of a tile. Subsequent rows are filled in the same manner, except
 * they use the previous row as input until the chunk is completed.
 * <br />
 * Peach also utilizes the nonce restrictions designed for use with
 * Trigg's algorithm, to retain the pleasantries of using haikus.
 * ```

 * @note If compiled with `ENABLE_CPU_PEACH_CACHE`, peach_solve()
 * generates and stores tiles in a statically aallocated Peach Map
 * and cache taking up 1 Gibibyte and 1 Mibibyte, respectively,
 * enabling a "mining advantage" with the reuse of generated tiles.
