## [2.4.3] - June 1st, 2023

Service setup updates and improvements to miner for RTX4090 and future performance advancement of GPU architectures.

### Changed
- mochimo.service now waits for network to be available before starting
- setup script no longer install erroneous amounts of git software (installs `git` instead of `git-all`)
- moved a reasonable amount of CPU work to the GPU to improve performance of powerful GPUs on low tier hardware (specifically the RTX4090, but will also apply to future generations of GPU)

## [2.4.2] - July 12th, 2022

Implementation of the Adequate Systems Build-C repository for CI/CD processes and build utilities. Repository restructure in preparation for version 3.0 improvements. Some non-critical bug fixes related to the handling of transactions between block updates. Improvements to Peach POW Algorithm on all Cuda capable devices.
